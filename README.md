# trashtoss2017-2018
This is the final updated code from the 2017-2018 school year.

To get started with the Coding Team:

- Contact ideass@ucsc.edu if interested.
- Enroll in CRSN 152-01. Permission codes are available from the instructor. 
- Request to be added to the GitHub: https://github.com/trashtoss 
- Download the most recent code repository from GitHub: https://github.com/trashtoss/trashtoss2017-2018 
- Download Unity (Version 5.5.2p4) and create an account.
- One team member should upload the downloaded code repository to Unity as a new project. For version control, invite new members to contribute to this project via Unity Collab (in the sidebar) by adding each personâ€™s Unity account emails. Once complete, all members should be able to edit the code, push new changes, and pull changes that have been added by other team-members, while working on the same project.
- Meet and collaborate as a team to edit the app and come up with new ideas!

Trash Toss: An interactive gaming application for androids implemented by UCSC students in collaboration with the IDEASS program.

INSTALLATION GUIDE: Must use Unity 5.5.2p4, conveyor belt flickers otherwise. Different animation system might fix. https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/patch-releases/5.5.2p4

Must use Android SDK Tools 25.2.5 http://dl.google.com/android/repository/tools_r25.2.5-windows.zip

File -> Build Settings -> Android

Using Unity with Git does not work well at all. Instead, use Unity Collab - version control that is included directly in Unity. Multiple people can collaborate on code and push to the master branch. Only downside is that you cannot go back to a previous state of the project after commiting. So make sure there are no bugs in the code before you add your changes to Unity Collab.


***Note that the current version of Trash Toss has been updated to the Android app store, as of June 2018.
